  <b>JUJUTSU KAISEN</b> is a serialized manga series with story and artwork by <b>Gege Akutami</b> and published in Weekly Shonen Jump. An anime adaptation came shortly after, with animation handled by Studio <b>MAPPA.</b> Currently there are multiple seasons with Season 1 (24 episodes) being followed by the highly acclaimed prequel movie <b>JUJUTSU KAISEN 0</b>, and then Season 2 in July 2023.
   The series is available subbed on <b>RETROWATCH</b>.
  Follow young <b><i>Yuji Itadori</i></b> in this dark supernatural action series as he begins training in the dangerous arts of jujutsu sorcery and explores the violent world of curses!
  Yuji Itadori eats a cursed finger to save a classmate, and now <b><i>Ryomen Sukuna</i></b>, a powerfully evil sorcerer known as the <b><u> King of Curses</u></b>,
  lives in Itadori’s soul. Curses are supernatural terrors created from negative human emotions. This cursed energy can be used as a power source by jujutsu sorcerers and cursed spirits alike.
  Guided by the jujutsu sorcerers, Yuji Itadori joins Tokyo Jujutsu High School, an organization that fights the curses. Mentored by his teacher Satoru Gojo, Itadori befriends Megumi Fushiguro and Nobara Kugisaki, both first-year students. 
  Season 2 rewinds the clock as students Satoru Gojo and Suguru Geto are tasked with protecting the Star Plasma Vessel. In October 2018, a Veil falls on Shibuya. Gojo enters with Itadori and other jujutsu sorcerers outside, unaware of Geto’s trap.
  Akutami stated that Neon Genesis Evangelion influenced the mythological aspects of the series,[9] being also influenced by horror and found footage films.Akutami is particularly a fan of Yoshihiro Togashi, author of YuYu Hakusho and Hunter × Hunter,expressing intentions to have an art style as close as possible to his. The author is also a fan of Tite Kubo, author of Bleach, and discussed in an interview with him the similarities between their works.Other manga artists who influenced Akutami include Masashi Kishimoto (Naruto) and Yusuke Murata (Eyeshield 21 and One-Punch Man illustrator). The magic system of Jujutsu Kaisen is largely inspired by Hunter × Hunter, whose fights, in Akutami's words, "rejects emotional arguments", stating however, that like Daisuke Ashihara, World Trigger's author, whose magic system is also similar to Togashi's series, Akutami is trying to find and develop their own style. In particular, Akutami commented that the first chapter was a mix of Bleach and Naruto.
